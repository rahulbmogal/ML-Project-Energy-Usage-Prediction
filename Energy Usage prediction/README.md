# Energy Usage Prediction
## WHERE to get the data:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/overview

The dataset building_meta.csv, test.csv, train.csv, weather_test.csv, weather_train.csv were used.

## EDA

### Load Datasets:
- Change folder path to correct path of folder containing all datasets.



## MODELLING

### Import Libraries:
- These are just the key libraries, further imports occur throughout the code too.

### Initial Preprocessing:
- This is a condensed version of the preprocessing that was done in the EDA file.
- Change folder path to correct path of folder containing all datasets.

### Random Forest:
- The hyperparameter optimisation takes quite a while to run, so only do so if you have a spare 6 hours!

### LSTM Recurrent Neural Network:
- This model can easily be trained on other buildings by simply changing the building_id in the first cell.
